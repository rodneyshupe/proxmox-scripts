# Proxmox Scripts

This is a collection of scripts to help setup a Proxmox server.  These
are created for my specific installation and use but may be informative
for others.

Initial Setup (this should be run as root):

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rodneyshupe/proxmox-scripts/main/setup.sh --output-document=setup.sh
sudo bash setup.sh
```
